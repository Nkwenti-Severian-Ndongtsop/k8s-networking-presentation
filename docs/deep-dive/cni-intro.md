# ðŸ”Œ CNI â€“ Container Network Interface

In Kubernetes, networking is handled through a powerful standard called **CNI** (Container Network Interface). Itâ€™s the component responsible for **assigning IP addresses and connecting pods to the network**.

## ðŸ§± What is CNI?

CNI is a specification and set of plugins used by container runtimes (like `containerd`, `crun`, or `Kata`) to configure network interfaces for Linux containers.

> ðŸ“Œ Think of CNI as the tool that **plugs the pod into the network**.

## ðŸ”Œ CNI â€“ Container Network Interface

CNI (Container Network Interface) is a standard interface and a set of plugins used to configure networking for containers. It's triggered by the container runtime when a pod is created.

It handles:

- ðŸ“¡ Assigning unique IP addresses to pods
- ðŸ”— Connecting pods to the node's network
- ðŸ§© Working with container runtimes like `containerd`, `crun`, `Kata`
