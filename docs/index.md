# üöÄ Welcome to the Kubernetes Networking Flow Presentation

## Unraveling the Network Fabric of K8s

Welcome! This presentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the intricate networking mechanisms within a Kubernetes cluster. We'll demystify how pods communicate, how services expose applications, and how external traffic finds its way into your cluster.

Whether you're new to Kubernetes or looking to deepen your understanding of its networking superpowers, this guide will walk you through the essential concepts and their practical implications.

## üó∫Ô∏è What We'll Explore

### Core Networking Concepts
* **CNI - Container Network Interface:** The foundational piece connecting pods to the network.
* **Pod-to-Pod Networking:** How containers within different pods communicate with each other.
* **Node-to-Node Networking:** The underlying network that enables communication across different worker nodes.
* **External Cluster Networking:** Exposing your applications outside the cluster using various Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) and Ingress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Demonstration Environment

For the demonstration, we will illustrate the concepts using some manifest files.
