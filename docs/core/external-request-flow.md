# 🌐 How a Request Flows from Outside to a Pod

This slide visualizes the journey of a request, from the moment a user initiates it to the point where it's handled by our application inside a Kubernetes pod.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🔹 Step 1: Client Request Initiated

It all begins when a user in their browser types in our domain name, like `https://example.com`, and hits enter.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: DNS Resolution

The browser needs to find the correct server.  
It uses a public **DNS service** to resolve `example.com` into a specific **IP address** — this is the IP address of our **LoadBalancer**.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: LoadBalancer Receives Request

The request reaches the **LoadBalancer**, which acts as the cluster’s external access point.  
Its job is to forward this request:

- To a **NodePort** on one of the Kubernetes nodes
- Or to the **Ingress Controller**, if one is used.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Ingress Controller (Optional Layer)

If present, the **Ingress Controller** behaves like a smart router:  
It inspects the **host** and **path** in the URL and routes the request to the correct **Service** inside the cluster.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Service (ClusterIP)

The request is handed off to a **ClusterIP Service**.  
This internal load balancer routes the request to one of the healthy and available **pods** behind it.

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Pod Handles Request

The request arrives at the target **Pod**.  
Inside the pod, the application:

- Processes the request
- Performs necessary actions
- Sends back a response

---

## 🔁 Response Path

The response travels back through:

1. The **Service**
2. (Optional) **Ingress Controller**
3. The **LoadBalancer**
4. Back to the **client’s browser**

---

> 📌 The entire flow is **transparent** and **reversible**, thanks to Kubernetes’ networking model.
